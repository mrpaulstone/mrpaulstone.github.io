This site is built using a framework called Hugo, which is a static site generator. I now have it setup using github actions to automatically re-build the static pages whenever I push code to my Github repo.

Its pretty cool to see github actions runners do the work automatically. 

TLDR; this portfolio/blog site is powered by a free pipeline, thanks Github!
